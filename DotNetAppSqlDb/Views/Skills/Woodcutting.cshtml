    The canoe system is very useful for getting around. I use it a lot since it is great for getting between the edgeville dungeon mine and the lumbridge furnace.

<p>
    While on my long fishing trip trying to get 96 fishing at Barbarian village, I made lots of
    canoes for getting back to barbarian village after casting home teleport to grab free midn and air runes.
    I gained 2 levels from this; 53 - 55.
